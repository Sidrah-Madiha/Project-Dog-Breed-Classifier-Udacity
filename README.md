# Project-Dog-Breed-Classifier-Udacity
This is the second project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program (Building a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.)

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
